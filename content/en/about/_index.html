<h1 class="text-center">I'm a systems engineer with a long background in industrial control systems (ICS).</h1>
<h3 class="text-center">I spent many years in the oil and gas industry designing, building, deploying, and supporting automation systems for what we called "downstream" delivery.  This time was a ton of fun because one day I could be hacking away at the Linux based automation servers and the next I could be out in the field dressed in head to toe Nomex testing and fixing electrical system terminations.</h2>

<h1 class="text-center">I later moved into a DevOps role in the renewable energy sector.</h1>
<h3 class="text-center">This was a dream come true.  Not only had I moved into the cutting edge of cloud computing, I could still leverage my ICS background to help accomplish what I still consider to be one of humanities most important missions.
It was here that I was finally exposed to concepts such as Infrastructure as Code (IaC), the value of writing IaC in an idempotent and deterministic manner, and the mac daddy of the cloud, Kubernetes.

  <h1 class="text-center">After work, I'm a family man.</h1>
  <h3 class="text-center">I try to spend as much time with my family as possible.  I bike, hike, enjoy woodworking, working on cars, and photography.  I'm a massive coffee nerd.  I love cigars.  I hunt, shoot, and fish as time permits.</h3>
