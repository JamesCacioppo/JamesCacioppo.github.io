My dad and I have built a new Ford 302ci small block engine.  The block in my '91 Mustang cracked many years ago so this new engine is a replacement.  I say new but it's a low milage E6SE block I purchased used.  I stripped it down and brought it to a machine shop for cleaning, honing, and anything else it might have needed.  To my surprise, after mic'ing the bores, crank and cam shaft, cam and main bearing journals, the machinist informed me that I had a really nice low milage engine and offered to buy it.  Of course, I said no.  I still needed an engine for the '91.

It took several years to build.  Life has a way of getting in the way.  Children are even better at it.  We finally finished it in 2022.  By 2023 we'd swapped the scuffed engine for the new build.  Last Saturday was D-day.  We were ready to kick the tires and light the fires.  After topping off all fluids, oil, coolant, brake fluid, power steering fluid, etc., I was looking over the engine and making sure the vacuum lines and wiring were all in place.  That's when I noticed the catastrophe.  Oil was streaming onto my garage floor.

We couldn't get under the car because there was oil everywhere and from the side of the car we couldn't exactly tell where the oil was coming from.  I ran up to Autozone looking for the old school kitty litter oil cleanup stuff.  Of course, they were out, but they had this stuff called *Pig Mat*.

This wonder roll is new to me and completely blew my mind.  I laid the mat down in a single layer and was immediately able to get under the car and identify some things.  The oil plugs (yes, that's right, it's plural) were tight so no leak there.  The leak was coming from the rear of the engine.  The oil pan was dry so it wasn't the gasket.  The leak was dripping off the bottom of the bell housing onto the floor.  That meant one thing: there was an issue with the rear main seal.

This was a huge blow and a devastating determination.
